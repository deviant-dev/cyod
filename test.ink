You ride the midnight run. Where do you get off?


+ Right here.
You try to step off... and find you step right back on again.
+ At 69th ave.
You aren't yet limber enough for that district, I'm afraid.
+ With my right.
And that's a helluva right you have too. It gets you right off... and right back on again.
